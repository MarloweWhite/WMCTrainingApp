In this project I was tasked by a company to make an app which would allow customers to purchase courses without having to call up the office and thus allowing them to
be purchased at all hours and then the payment process being handled externally due to sponsors needing to get involved and other background procedures. I Learnt a great deal
through this as I had limited support from lecturers as the project was embarked upon outside term time so various skills such as problem solving were improved.

Ways I could improve this would be to adhere to either the Google or Sun check coding standards and adding in automated tests. Another thing would be to make the code 
a lot more scalable as it makes it a lot more easier to re-use and is better practice for bigger projects.

Due to unforseen circumstances the app was not continued to the live stage and being placed on the play store.

I hope you enjoy looking at this project and in turn consider my application.

Most Sincerely

Marlowe
